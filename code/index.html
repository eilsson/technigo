			<h1>Responsive design</h1>
		</header>
		<p><span class="glossary-term">Responsive design</span> is when a website's layout and content adjust to different screen sizes of various devices. To 		create a responsive website you need HTML and CSS, but can also use JavaScript to enhance the experience. A responsive layout with images, videos and 			other media that resize as needed is achieved by using a fluid grid, relative units for widths and sizes and CSS media queries that tell the browser when to 	adjust the layout and content depending on screen size and orientation.</p>
